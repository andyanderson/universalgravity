## Functions for the laws of gravity

* g(r): Calculates the acceleration of gravity at any distance from the center of the Earth.
		Here G is the Universal Constant of Gravitation and M is the mass of the Earth
* gsurface(planet):	Calculate surface gravity of a planet, using (mass, radius) as input
